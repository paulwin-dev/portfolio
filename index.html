            <p>
                I'm a 15 year old fullstack developer based in Germany.
                Since starting my journey as a developer almost <b>half a decade</b> ago, 
                I've contributed to more than <span style="color: gold;"> 4 million visits</span> and become familiar with 
                a number of game engines. The engines I'm most experienced with are: <br>
                <span style="color: rgb(109, 135, 239);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span> Roblox Studio <br>
                <span style="color: rgb(109, 135, 239);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span> Unity 3D & 2D <br>
                <span style="color: rgb(109, 135, 239);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span> Construct3 <br>
                In addition to these game engines, I have experience making 2D games from scratch
                using the Java AWT and Swing libraries. I'm also familiar with a bunch of programming languages,
                including (ranked from most familiar to least): <br>
                <span style="color: rgb(254, 196, 37);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</span> Luau <br>
                <span style="color: rgb(209, 209, 209);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span> Java <br>
                <span style="color: rgb(239, 172, 109);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</span> Python <br>
                <span style="color: rgb(109, 135, 239);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.</span> JavaScript <br>
                <span style="color: rgb(109, 135, 239);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</span> C# <br>
                If you have a project in mind that uses a language not included above, please feel free
                to reach out regardless and I can likely learn the language while working on your project!
                <span style="color: gold;"> Thank you for checking out my portfolio and I hope to work with you soon!</span>

                        As lead programmer for this project, I added many things

                        On its way to becoming the next big realistic roblox shooter, I am leading the scripting
                        process of this game. I've coded everything that's currently in the game except the gun system,
                        including from a round system, all the UI, quests, the level system, and more. In addition to that,
                        I'm working on a realistic jet system for the game, currently testeable <a class="item-link-p" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/133521604713323/Jet-Fighter-Testing">here</a>.

                        Sadly cancelled, this project was a copy of Sol's RNG about
                        rolling for swords and fighting with them. I created an
                        exploit-safe rolling system, global leaderboards, an inventory system
                        and a currency and fighting system. Note that the video shown above is
                        an early prototype of the actual rolling system.

                        A personal project I've been working on since April 2024 now, the game is close to completion.
                        It was heavily inspired by "find cheese to feed a rat" by Jimmalonia and is about getting out of
                        debt within 3 days. The game includes a dialogue system, light & door systems, a thought-out storyline,
                        and much more. The game linked above is a playable yet incomplete version of the game from mid-June 2024.

                        Since learning Java in January 2024, I've always disliked how annoying it is to
                        create even a simple game. To fix this, I created the JGame framework. It uses all the
                        building blocks included in the AWT and Swing libraries but provides a developer friendly
                        API with a stable game loop, many different instances like images and rectangles and services
                        that allow things such as tweening, raycasting, and detecting input. Many names and functionalities
                        of this framework were derived from Roblox.
